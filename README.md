## 🚀 Deployment (Railway)

This app is designed for **separate deployment** of:

- 🧑‍🎨 **Frontend** (React + Vite) — deploy as a **Static Site** on Railway.
- ⚙️ **Backend** (NestJS or any REST API) — separate Railway service.
- 🗃️ **Database** (PostgreSQL) — also deployed on Railway.

> Make sure to define `VITE_API_URL` in your `.env` file in the frontend:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://meme-api-swn0.onrender.com/api
```
